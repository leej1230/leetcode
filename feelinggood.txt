Dynamic Programming (1D 2D)
- Think about this topic when you see a word "max" or "min" in a question sentence
- Draw a tree and identify a subproblem
    - See if anything can be memoized
- Look at the question from different point of view
    - ex) Do we have to make check the string is same with target in every iteration?
            Can that be done by only using index?
- Hash map is BFF
