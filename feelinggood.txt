GIT
- git add *
- git commit -m "commit message here"
- git push

- git log --graph: Shows the history of the repository
- git merge branch-name: Merge branch to current branch
- git checkout branch-name: Switch a branch to branch-name

Dynamic Programming (1D 2D)
- Think about this topic when you see a word "max" or "min" in a question sentence
- Draw a tree and identify a subproblem
    - See if anything can be memoized
- Look at the question from different point of view
    - ex) Do we have to make check the string is same with target in every iteration?
            Can that be done by only using index?
- Hash map is BFF with memoization
- Patterns
    - Coin Change
    - 2D
    - 1D
    - Make decision tree and dfs (use memoization)
    - Original formula with subproblems

Greedy Algorithm
- Most of the time, minimum heap is involved
- Python only has minimum but notice how we can have maximum heap if we multiply -1 to all the values
- Somewhat similar to DP
    - So start from writing a decision tree aka best friend
- Find what can be rejected from consideration (Q.1899)

Sliding Window Strategy (Q. 424, 76)
- Make window by having left and right pointer (while r < len(sth))
- Problem should be something related to substring
- Think when the window will be valid to the condition that needs to be satisfied to solve the Problem
    - Ex) If the problem asks window to contain same character -> then the window is valid iff there's same characters in the window

Stack
- Monotonic Decreasing Stack
    - Stack that has numbers in decreasing order
    - If the lower number is added, keep popping until it reaches lower number is found
